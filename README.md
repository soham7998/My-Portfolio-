# My-Portfolio


I'm excited to share my first portfolio project with all of you! After months of hard work and determination, I'm proud to say that my portfolio is finally live and available for the world to see! 

Using Python, Flask, HTML and CSS programming languages, I was able to create a stunning portfolio website. I showcased my skills in web design and incorporated a range of features such as custom images, navigation menus, contact forms and more. 

I invite everyone to take a look at my portfolio website here: **(Portfolio Link)[http://soham2003.pythonanywhere.com/index.html]**. It's been a great experience building this project from scratch. Feedback is always welcomed and appreciated!
